This repository contains an example of a potential buffer overflow in Assembly code. The bug is caused by adding the value in ecx to the value at [ebx+4] and storing the result at ebx, which can lead to data corruption or program crashes if the memory allocated at ebx is not large enough. The bugSolution.asm file provides a corrected version of the code that checks for buffer overflow conditions before performing the addition.
